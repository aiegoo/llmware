    "     Fast Start Example #5 - RAG with Semantic Query<br>\n",
    "    This example illustrates the most common RAG retrieval pattern, which is using a semantic query, e.g.,<br>\n",
    "    a natural language query, as the basis for retrieving relevant text chunks, and then using as<br>\n",
    "    the context material in a prompt to ask the same question to a LLM.<br>\n",
    "    In this example, we will show the following:<br>\n",
    "    1.  Create library and install embeddings (feel free to skip / substitute a library created in an earlier step).<br>\n",
    "    2.  Ask a general semantic query to the entire library collection.<br>\n",
    "    3.  Select the most relevant results by document.<br>\n",
    "    4.  Loop through all of the documents - packaging the context and asking our questions to the LLM.<br>\n",
    "    NOTE: to use chromadb, you may need to install the python sdk:  pip3 install chromadb.<br>\n"
