    "    1. Collection on a Database - this is the core of the Library, and is created through parsing of documents, which<br>\n",

    "    and the collection that will be used as the basis for tracking any number of vector embeddings that can be<br>\n",
    "    attached to a library collection.<br>\n",
    "    2. File archives - found in the llmware_data path, within Accounts, there is a folder structure for each Library.<br>\n",
    "    All file-based artifacts for the Library are organized in these folders, including copies of all files added in<br>\n",

    "    documents, as well as derived artifacts such as nlp and knowledge graph and datasets.<br>\n",

    "    To parse into a Library, there is the very useful convenience methods, \"add_files\" which will invoke the Parser,<br>\n",
